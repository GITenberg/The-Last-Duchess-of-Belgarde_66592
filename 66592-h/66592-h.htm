<p class="drop-cap">IN the great, green old garden
of Madame, the Countess of
Floramour, sat her granddaughter,
little Mademoiselle
Trimousette, wondering when
she was to be married and to whom. Such an
enterprise was afoot, and even then being arranged,
but nobody, so far, had condescended
to give Trimousette any of the particulars.
She was stitching demurely at her tambour
frame, while in her lap lay an open volume
of Ronsard. Every now and then her rosy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
lips murmured the delicious verses of the poet.
A very pale, quiet little person was Mademoiselle
Trimousette, with a pair of tragic black
eyes, and something in her air so soft, so
pensive, so appealing, that it almost made up
for the beauty she lacked. Although the only
granddaughter of the rich, the highly born
and the redoubtable Countess of Floramour,
little Trimousette was the very soul of humility,
and in her linen gown and straw hat
might have passed for a shepherdess of
Arcady.</p>

<p>A clump of gnarled and twisted rose trees
made a niche for her small white figure on
the garden bench. To one side was the yew
alley, where the clipped hedge met overhead,
making the alley dark even in the May noontime.
Before Trimousette stood, in a little
open space, a cracked sundial, on which could
still be made out in worn letters the legend:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>L&#8217;ombre passe, et repasse:</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Sans repasser, l&#8217;homme passe.</i></div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>This sounded very sad to little sixteen-year-old
Trimousette; shadows passed and re-passed;
but men, passing once, passed forever.
She sighed, and then her young heart turned
away to sweeter, brighter things as she again
took up her tambour frame. She knew the
motto on the sundial well, did little Trimousette,
but it always made her sad, from the
time she first spelled it out in her childish days.
However, her heart refused to give it more
than one little sigh to-day, as she turned again
to her embroidery and to her love dream. If
only she was to be married to the Duke of Belgarde&mdash;that
splendid, daredevil duke, whom
she had once seen face to face, and to whom
she had yielded her innocent heart and all her
glowing imagination! Her grandmother, the
old countess, who was frightfully pious, probably
would not let little Trimousette marry
the duke, not even if he asked her; the Duke
of Belgarde could not, by any stretch of the
imagination, be called a pious person. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
Trimousette believed firmly that all the wild
duke needed to make him a model of propriety
was a little tender remonstrance and perhaps
a kiss or two&mdash; Here Trimousette held her
embroidery frame up to her eyes to hide the
hot blushes that leaped into her pale cheeks.</p>

<p>Presently came striding along the garden
path the fierce old Countess of Floramour, as
tall as a bean pole, and with a voice like an
auctioneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all arranged,&#8221; she said to little Trimousette,
&#8220;and you are to be married to the
Duke of Belgarde.&#8221;</p>

<p>The blood dropped out of Trimousette&#8217;s
face, like water dashed from a vase. She had
risen when she saw the old countess approaching.
Everybody rose when the old countess
approached, for she was a martinet to the
backbone. The volume of Ronsard fell out
of Trimousette&#8217;s lap, and Madame de Floramour
pounced upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reading poetry, indeed!&#8221; she cried indignantly;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
&#8220;precious little use will you find for
poetry when you are a duchess. You will be
visiting morning, noon, and night, until you
can hardly stand upon your legs, and receiving
visits until your head swims, or going to balls
and routs when you should be in bed, and
trailing after their Majesties until you are
ready to drop, and racking your brain for
compliments to frowsy old women and doddering
old men, and doing everything you don&#8217;t
want to do&mdash;that&#8217;s being a duchess. Still,
it is a fine thing to be a duchess.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dark-eyed Trimousette scarcely heard anything
of this; her ear had caught only the
words&mdash;&#8220;the Duke of Belgarde&#8221;&mdash;and she
was dazzled and stunned with the splendid
vision that rose before her like magic at the
speaking of the winged words. Nevertheless,
she managed to gasp out:</p>

<p>&#8220;And when am I to be married, grandmamma?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you see my coach with six horses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
drive into the courtyard, miss&mdash;then you are
to be married, and not before.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this the old countess stalked off, and
Trimousette fell into a rapturous dream, her
head resting upon her hand. So motionless
was she that a pair of bluebirds, still in their
honeymoon, cooed and chirped almost at her
feet. The world held but one object for Trimousette
at that moment&mdash;the Duke of Belgarde.
She knew his first name&mdash;Fernand&mdash;and
her lips involuntarily moved as if speaking
it. A heavenly glow seemed to envelop the
old garden, the sundial with its melancholy
motto, the dark yew walk, bathing them in a
golden glory. Before her dreamy eyes returned
the vision of the day she had seen the
Duke of Belgarde, and had laid her innocent,
trembling heart at his feet, just as a subject
bows before his king, without waiting to be
told. It was exactly a year ago, on a May
day, and it was close by the Tuileries gardens.
Madame de Floramour&#8217;s great coach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
was drawn up, waiting to see King Louis the
Sixteenth and Queen Marie Antoinette pass
to some great ceremony at Notre Dame. The
duke in a gorgeous riding dress, and superbly
horsed, was among the courtiers, and on seeing
a certain beautiful lady, Madame de
Valen&ccedil;ay, he dismounted, and stood uncovered
talking with her, the sun gleaming upon his
powdered hair, and making his sword hilt
shine as a single jewel. How well Trimousette
remembered Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay&#8217;s glorious
blonde beauty! She seemed, in her pale violet
satin robe that matched the color of her eyes,
a part of the splendid pageant of earth and sky
that day. At the first sight of her a sudden,
sharp, jealous pain rent Trimousette&#8217;s little
heart. Instantly she realized that she was small
and pale, and her gown was dull in color. The
duke scarcely saw her, as he left Madame de
Valen&ccedil;ay&#8217;s side long enough to speak to the
old countess. Trimousette, making herself as
small as possible in the corner of the coach,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
was, as usual, completely swamped by Madame
de Floramour&#8217;s enormous hoop, tremendous
hat and feathers, and voluminous fan.
The old lady, who had a fierce virtue which
she would not have hesitated to cram down
the throat of the King himself, was lecturing
the duke upon the sin of gaming, to which he
was addicted, along with several other mortal
sins. He listened with laughing, impenitent
eyes, and grinning delightfully, swore he
would make public confession of his sins and
lead a life thereafter as innocent as that of
the daisies of the field. Behind him, while
he was talking, shone the lovely, fair face
of Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay, all dimpling with
smiles.</p>

<p>Not the least notice did the duke take of
little Trimousette until, the old countess preparing
to alight and walk about while waiting
for their Majesties, Trimousette stepped
timidly out of the coach after her. One vagrant
glance of the duke&#8217;s fell upon Trimousette&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
little, little feet, encased in beautiful
red-heeled shoes, and, as he turned away with
a low bow and a sweep of his hat, Trimousette&#8217;s
quick ear heard him say to a companion
standing by: &#8220;What charming little
feet!&#8221;</p>

<p>From that day Trimousette&#8217;s innocent head
had been full of this adorable, impudent
scapegrace of a duke. She did not, like older
and wiser women, try to put him out of her
mind, but cherished her idyl, as young things
will; only, he seemed too far above her and
beyond her. And the beautiful Madame de
Valen&ccedil;ay was certainly better suited to so
splendid a being as the Duke of Belgarde
than a small creature like herself, so Trimousette
thought. But she had not read the story
of Cinderella for nothing&mdash;and small feet had
carried the day in that case over beauty in
all its pride.</p>

<p>The duke divided the empire of Trimousette&#8217;s
soul with her brother, Count Victor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
of Floramour, who was an edition in small of
the Duke of Belgarde, whom he ardently admired
and earnestly copied, especially in his
debts. Count Victor had succeeded in piling
up quite a respectable number of obligations,
but unlike the Duke of Belgarde, who feared
nobody, Victor was in mortal terror of his
grandmother, the old countess. She held the
reins tight over her grandson as over everybody
else, and gave him about enough of an
allowance to keep him in silk stockings.
Being an officer of the Queen&#8217;s Musketeers,
Victor had a great many opportunities to
spend money, which he alleged was a solemn
duty he owed her Majesty, the Queen.
This was devoutly believed by Trimousette,
but the old countess scoffed at it. Trimousette
had determined, if she made a rich marriage,
she would ask her husband to pay
Victor&#8217;s debts, even if they were so much as
a thousand louis d&#8217;ors&mdash;and now&mdash;ah, sweet
delight!&mdash;she was to be married to the finest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
the most beautiful duke in the world, who
no doubt was as rich as he was grand. The
thought of Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay disturbed
Trimousette a little, but she believed if she
was very sweet and loving with the duke, and
sang him pretty little songs, and always wore
enchanting red-heeled shoes, he would soon
forget Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay.</p>

<p>The duke had more than one splendid ch&acirc;teau,
but Trimousette had heard of the small
old castle of Boury, on the coast of Brittany,
where the duke was born. Thither Trimousette
decided they would go directly they
were married; for, of course, the duke&mdash;or
Fernand, as Trimousette already called him
in her thoughts&mdash;would ask her where she
wished to go. In her day dream she saw the
place&mdash;an old stone fortalice, perched on the
brown Breton rocks, with a garden of hardy
shrubs and flowers, straying almost to the
cliff, and seagulls clanging overhead in the
sharp blue air. There would Trimousette and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
her duke live like their Majesties at the Little
Trianon, where the Count d&#8217;Artois milked
the cow, and Queen Marie Antoinette herself
skimmed the cream from the milk pails. The
Queen, too, always wore a linen gown and a
straw hat when she was at the Little Trianon,
and Trimousette would dress in the same way
at Boury.</p>

<p>While all these idle, sweet fancies floated
through her mind, like white butterflies dancing
in the sun, she glanced up and saw Victor
coming toward her. Victor did not
march across the flower beds like the old
countess, but slinked along through the yew
alley, in the dull green light that brooded
upon it even at noontide. He was like Trimousette,
only ten times handsomer, and gave
indications of having seen a good deal of life.
To-day, it was plain he had been up all night.
He was unshaven, his hat had lost its jaunty
cock, his waistcoat was wine-stained, and the
lace on his sleeves had been badly damaged in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
a romp with some very gay ladies about four
o&#8217;clock that morning.</p>

<p>Victor beckoned to Trimousette, and she
rose and went into the cool, dark alley with
him where they were quite secure from observation.
Then, taking Trimousette&#8217;s hand, he
kissed it gallantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you want to be a duchess, my little
sister,&#8221; he said, laughing, yet kindly. &#8220;I
hope you will be happy, but don&#8217;t get any
nonsense in your romantic head about you
and Belgarde living like a pair of blue pigeons
in an almond tree. Belgarde is a gay dog
if ever I saw one. We were together last
night&mdash;and look!&#8221; Victor showed his tattered
ruffles and battered hat, and touched his
unshaven chin. &#8220;We went to a little supper
together, which began at midnight, and is
just over now within the hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trimousette firmly believed that she would
be able to cure her duke of his taste for such
suppers, but she was too timid to put her belief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
in words. She said, however, after a
blushing pause:</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing I mean to ask the duke as soon
as we are married, and that is for some
money to pay your debts, dear Victor.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that Victor sat down on the ground and
laughed until he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are as innocent as the birds upon the
bushes, my little duchess,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Belgarde
pay my debts! He cannot pay his own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But yours cannot be so very large,&#8221; urged
Trimousette earnestly. &#8220;If it were even as
much as a thousand louis d&#8217;ors, I should ask
the duke to give it to me, and if he loved
me&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused with downcast eyes, and Victor
stopped laughing and looked at her with pity.
What an innocent, affectionate, guileless child
she was, and what a lesson lay before her!</p>

<p>&#8220;My debts amount to a good deal more
than a thousand louis d&#8217;ors,&#8221; he responded,
smiling in spite of himself at Trimousette&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
simplicity. &#8220;You will have a good many
thousands of louis d&#8217;ors at your command,
my little duchess, but you will need them
all yourself; for Belgarde will have his wife
finely dressed, and your hotel and equipages
must be suitable to your rank.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall always be able to spare a little
for you, Victor,&#8221; answered Trimousette, looking
at him with adoring eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Belgarde will not mind the money; he is
a free-handed, generous fellow, as brave as
my sword. But you must not try to domesticate
him, you must become gay like himself.
Belgarde told me on our way home just now
that everything had been arranged, and that
he meant to treat you well. I answered, if
he did not, I would run him through the
body; and so I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>At which Trimousette was frightened half
to death, and replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then if he treats me ill, I will never let
you know anything about it.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE DUCHESS OF BELGARDE</small></h3>
</div></div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dropcap_n.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NEVER was a bride less burdened
with the details of her marriage
than was Mademoiselle
Trimousette. Her grandmother
arranged the settlements, provided
the trousseau, and did not even let
Trimousette see the marriage presents, which
the duke sent in a couple of large hampers,
until the day before the wedding.</p>

<p>The duke did not take the trouble to see
his little bride in advance of the formal betrothal,
which took place the week after Trimousette<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
had sat and stitched by the old
sundial in the garden. The betrothal ceremony
took place in the grandest of all of the
grand saloons in the hotel of Madame de
Floramour. Everything was done in splendor,
and the bride herself, for the first time
in her life, was expensively dressed and wore
jewels. When she entered the grand saloon
on Victor&#8217;s arm, her eyes were downcast, and
she felt as if she were under some enchanting
spell. She saw nothing but her adorable duke,
with his laughing eyes, and dashing figure,
and slim, sinewy hands over which fell lace
ruffles.</p>

<p>The duke glanced at his bride with good-humored
indifference. She was too young,
too unformed to reveal what she might yet
become, but she looked so gentle, so unresisting,
that she appeared to be a very suitable
duchess for a duke who took his pleasure
wherever he found it. The only thing he
noticed especially about her were her dainty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
feet, in little white satin shoes, and her black
eyes, hidden under her downcast lids. He
recognized the melancholy glory of her eyes,
but thought them too tragic for everyday
use. Personally, he much preferred Madame
de Valen&ccedil;ay&#8217;s blue orbs, languid, yet sparkling.
That charming lady was present, and
appeared in nowise chagrined. Shortly before
the betrothal, she had suggested to the duke
that she should put the Count de Valen&ccedil;ay
out of the way, in order to make a vacancy in
his shoes for the duke; de Valen&ccedil;ay was always
ailing, and could easily be made a little
more so. The duke declined the proposition,
as every other man has done to whom it
has been made since the dawn of time. But
he had assured Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay that
neither a husband nor a wife counted in an
all-consuming passion such as theirs, and she
believed him. The future duchess pleased
Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay quite as much as Trimousette
pleased the duke. Surely, that small,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
timid, almost voiceless creature ought not and
should not stand in the way of two determined
lovers like the Duke of Belgarde and
Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay.</p>

<p>Few persons present took any more notice
of the young bride than did the prospective
bridegroom. The betrothal ceremony was
soon over and then a great dinner was served,
at which the future Duchess of Belgarde sat
next the duke at table. Amid the crowd of
merry faces, the cheerful noise and commotion
of a betrothal dinner, the lights and the
flowers, Trimousette saw only the duke&#8217;s
handsome, laughing, careless face, and heard
only his ringing voice. She was so quiet and
still during it all that it touched the duke a
little, although he had frankly determined in
advance he would not trouble himself very
much about his future duchess. He was impelled,
however, by a certain careless kindness,
which was a part of his nature, to pay
her a few small compliments. The blood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
rushed to Trimousette&#8217;s face and she raised
her black eyes to his with an expression
of adoration at once desperate and shy, so
that the duke privately resolved not to encourage
her to fall in love with him any more
than she was already. Nothing was more
inconvenient, thought the duke, than a wife
who is in love with her husband, except
perhaps a husband who is in love with his
wife.</p>

<p>The next night the wedding was celebrated.
First there was a great supper and ball preceding
the ceremony, which took place at
midnight, according to the fashion of the age,
at Notre Dame. It was a very grand wedding
indeed. The King and Queen were represented,
and half the old nobility of France
was present. In fact, there was so much of
rank and grandeur that the bride was as
nearly insignificant as a bride could well be.
Her costume was very gorgeous; she blazed
with jewels, which came from she knew not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
where, and she was attended by six young
ladies of the highest rank, whom she had
never before seen. When Trimousette entered
the first of the magnificent saloons, her
eyes timidly traveled over the splendors before
her. Some of the great rooms were
devoted to cards, others to dancing, where
an orchestra of twenty-four violins played,
after the manner of the orchestra of Louis
the Fourteenth, at whose court Madame de
Floramour had been a shining light. In another
huge hall a superb supper was served
by a hundred liveried lackeys, wearing wedding
favors.</p>

<p>But the only familiar faces the little bride
saw were her brother Victor&#8217;s and her grandmother&#8217;s
iron countenance, grimly resplendent
under a towering headdress of diamonds and
red feathers. Yes, there was another face
she knew well, though she had seen it but
twice&mdash;the lovely rosy-lipped Madame de
Valen&ccedil;ay. Trimousette, for all her outward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
timidity, had a shy and silent courage, which
appeared when least expected. She did not
really fear Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay, with all her
wit and beauty, for love is the universal conqueror.
So thought simple Trimousette. The
duke was quite civil to his bride, and she
mistook his civility for the beginnings of
love, and thought him more adorable than
ever.</p>

<p>Half an hour before midnight a great
string of coaches, with running footmen carrying
torches, started for the Cathedral of
Notre Dame, where the Archbishop of Paris,
with the assistance of a whole batch of cardinals,
was to perform the marriage ceremony.
The night, radiant and rose-scented, was the
loveliest of June nights. The crowds along
the streets hustled and pushed and scrambled
good-naturedly to get a sight of the young
bride. All agreed that she was not half handsome
enough for the beautiful, superb Duke
of Belgarde, and such, indeed, was the bride&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
own opinion. The duke was in the gayest
spirits. The more he saw of his bride, the
better she seemed suited to him. She was
certainly the meekest, most inoffensive creature
on earth, and if only she would not insist
on making love to him, it would be an
ideal marriage&mdash;for the Duke of Belgarde.
He congratulated himself that he had not
yielded to the seductions of Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay
when that spirited and fascinating lady
had offered to put her husband out of the
way to please the duke.</p>

<p>The wedding train, as it swept up the great
aisle of Notre Dame, blazed with splendor.
In it was the Count d&#8217;Artois, who not only
milked the cow charmingly at the Little Trianon,
but danced adorably on the tight rope.
The main altar of the old Cathedral, with
its thousands of candles, sparkled like a single
jewel. The huge organ thundered under
the echoing arches, and the great bells in the
towers clashed out joyfully their wedding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
music to the quiet stars in the heavens. The
melody, the beauty, the glory of it all found
an echo in the tender, simple heart of the new
Duchess of Belgarde.</p>

<small>A PRESENT FROM THE DUKE</small></h3>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dropcap_i.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">INSTEAD of a honeymoon at
Boury, the old Breton castle
on the cliffs over the sounding
seas, where the salt spray
upon the crumbling
towers, the Duke and Duchess of Belgarde
had a racketing time at the Ch&acirc;teau de Belgarde.
This was a great palace of a place in
the neighborhood of Versailles. There was
incessant dancing, dining, and merry-making
for three whole weeks, and the meek, silent
little bride grew so tired she could scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
stand upon her pretty feet. Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay
was much in evidence, and was easily
the loveliest of all the lovely women at the
Ch&acirc;teau de Belgarde. A vague uneasiness
came into the heart of the little duchess whenever
she looked upon this beautiful blue-eyed
creature always radiantly dressed. Trimousette,
however, still believed that she could
soon make her duke fall as deeply in love
with herself as she was irretrievably in love
with him. He was certainly kind to her, so
thought Trimousette with deep delight in her
innocent heart. She did not observe that
the duke&#8217;s kindness to her was exactly like
his kindness to his faithful hound, Diane, who
had broken both her forelegs in his service,
and though unable to hunt, limped about
after him with the desperate devotion of that
most sentimental of all creatures except a
woman&mdash;a dog. The duke did, indeed, show
a sort of protective instinct toward his silent,
shy, black-eyed young wife, and she noticed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
that Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay was more civil to
her when the duke was by than when he
was not. But it must be admitted that the
Duchess of Belgarde was shamefully bullied
in her own house from the day of her marriage
by Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay. Trimousette
bore it with the quiet, wordless courage which
enabled her to bear many things in silence,
and she continued to mistake her husband&#8217;s
casual good will for the beginnings of love
in its infancy. One day, less than a month
after her marriage, came the awakening. The
duchess saw a jeweler from Paris at the door
of the duke&#8217;s room. The duke was holding
in his hand a blue, heart-shaped locket with
diamonds in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will take this,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for one hundred
louis.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not see his duchess who was passing
a little to the back of him. A palpitating
joy shot through Trimousette&#8217;s heart. What
were all the jewels and laces and furs and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
silks in her marriage presents from the duke
compared to that charming little jeweled
heart, which he was choosing for her! The
duke thrust the trinket in his breast, dismissed
the man, and then turning, for the first time
saw his duchess walking along the broad,
bright corridor, flooded with the glow of the
summer morning. As he was going the same
way, he walked after Trimousette, and like
a gentleman he uttered some little phrase of
compliment. In all honesty, he preferred
her as his wife a million times more than
Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay, whom he could have
married, if only he had agreed to have the
present incumbent put out of the way. A
submissive person was what the duke particularly
desired for a wife, and he had got
one.</p>

<p>The little duchess&#8217;s heart beat so with joy
when her husband joined her that she was
almost suffocated, and could only say &#8220;Yes&#8221;
and &#8220;No&#8221; when the duke talked to her. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
was obliged to admit, however, after a few
minutes of this, as they passed through the
long, sunlit corridor out upon the gay terrace,
that his bride had not much conversational
power. And standing on the terrace,
surrounded by gentlemen, was Madame de
Valen&ccedil;ay, entertaining them all with the most
amusing badinage, and every word sparkled.
She seemed to embody the very spirit of the
rosy morn with her shining eyes, her ringing
voice, her gown of a jocund yellow.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, for Trimousette this trifling
attention of the duke toward her filled her
soul with rapture. There was a great ball
that night at the ch&acirc;teau, and she dressed herself
for it with gayety
of heart in a very unbecoming
gown selected for her by her fierce
old grandmother. Her innocent, hidden hope
and pleasure lasted until she entered the ballroom
to receive her guests. There, amid the
jewels sparkling upon Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay&#8217;s
breast, lay the little blue enameled heart.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>Something as near resentment as Trimousette
could feel stirred within her, and her
dark eyes grew sombre. She had a sudden
illumination. Never more would she mistake
the duke&#8217;s careless kindness for the beginnings
of love. But with the illumination of
her mind rose up that latent, still, wordless
courage which enabled her to bear almost
unbearable things without one sign of pain.
She was but a girl of seventeen, this injured
wife, this insulted duchess; she knew
nothing of retaliation, she only knew how to
suffer silently and with dignity. No one, not
even her brother Victor, should know of the
cruel affront put upon her in the first month
of her marriage. She forced herself to talk
and even to smile, and Victor, who was afraid
that Trimousette would never look or speak
or walk or act as a great duchess should,
began to have some hopes of her.</p>

<small>MADAME DE VALEN&Ccedil;AY</small></h3>
</div>
<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dropcap_t.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE gayety and racketing went
on during the whole year at
one place or another&mdash;the Ch&acirc;teau
de Belgarde, other ch&acirc;teaus,
Paris and Versailles.
Trimousette saw Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay oftener
than any other woman of her acquaintance.
Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay was fairly polite,
but in her eyes and smile lurked a kind
of insolence which the reticent young duchess
understood quite well, but of which she
made not the slightest sign. She had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
more liberty and not much more money as
Duchess of Belgarde than when she lived
in her grandmother&#8217;s house as a little demoiselle.
There was much to buy and to give,
and besides, ever since King Louis the Sixteenth
called the States General together, the
peasants had refused to pay their rents and
even their taxes, and the work people demanded
their money with threats and curses.
So far from having a thousand louis d&#8217;ors
with which to pay Victor&#8217;s debts, the poor
little duchess had only managed, by skimping
and saving in her own personal expenses, to
scrape together three hundred louis&mdash;and it
was so little she was ashamed to offer it to
Victor.</p>

<p>A year after her marriage Trimousette disappointed
and offended the duke very much
by bringing into the world a daughter. A son
would have been welcomed; but a girl&mdash;well,
the poor little thing, as if knowing she was
not wanted by anyone except her young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
mother, soon wailed her life away. Trimousette
grieved as one whose heart was broken,
and wore nothing but black. This still more
annoyed the duke, but on this point alone
Trimousette showed a slight obstinacy. The
duke wished her to go about, to visit Versailles,
to be seen at the theatre. The young
duchess humbly obeyed these instructions, but
not in the spirit the duke desired. Trimousette&#8217;s
heart, poor lonely captive, beat against
its prison bars, and made its melancholy cry
a little heard; then grew silent.</p>

<p>She led a life singularly lonely for a great
lady who received twice in the week, and who
went to a ball nearly every night. Her grandmother
thought she had done enough in marrying
Trimousette off to one of the greatest
dukes in France, and gave herself up to
sermons, taking no more thought of her
granddaughter. Victor had his own amusements,
as became an officer of the Queen&#8217;s
Musketeers and a gay dog. Only the poor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
broken-legged hound Diane seemed to seek
Trimousette&#8217;s company, and together the two
creatures who loved the duke listened for his
footsteps, and hung timidly upon his words.</p>

<p>But there was so great a noise of other
things in Paris that private woes were not
much heeded. It was impossible for a lady
to walk without molestation upon the streets
full of turbulent people, and it was actually
dangerous to drive about in a ducal coach.
The pavements were thronged by hungry creatures,
both men and women, with menacing
eyes, and threatening, yelling voices, who had
been known to scream and flout ladies in their
carriages, and to drag gentlemen from their
horses and maltreat them. Once Madame
de Valen&ccedil;ay, seeing Trimousette preparing
to go forth somewhat unwillingly in her
coach, hinted that perhaps the duchess was
afraid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the least, madame,&#8221; answered Trimousette
quietly. &#8220;Perhaps you will join me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
in my coach and drive with me to the Palais
Royal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay was so stunned by
this proposal that she accepted it, the duke
standing by and wondering if his taciturn
young duchess had not lost her wits.</p>

<p>The two ladies were assisted into the coach,
which set off toward the Palais Royal. It
was about seven in the evening when the
work of the day was over and the streets were
fullest of these ragged, starving beings who
had found voice at last, and shouted out the
story of their rags, their hunger, their misery,
and their determination to punish somebody
for it. The splendid coach and six of the
Duchess of Belgarde was like showing a red
rag to a bull. The mob surrounded it, hooting
and screaming, and wrenched the whips
from the hands of the coachmen and postilions,
and the canes from the three footmen
hanging on behind. Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay,
who had started out laughing and defiant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
grew pale and then frightened, and when a
wretched woman, with the glare of famine in
her eyes, dragged the coach door open and
tore the ribbons from Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay&#8217;s
hat, that lady fell to whimpering and almost
fainting with terror. Not so little Trimousette.
It had been complained of her often
that she was too silent and impassive, and she
remained so now, giving no sign whatever of
fear or uneasiness. She even smiled with a
faint contempt at Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay&#8217;s terrors,
and refused to give orders for the coachman
to return to the H&ocirc;tel de Belgarde until
they had made the circuit of the Palais Royal.
When they returned, the duke was awaiting
them in the courtyard of the hotel. He was
wondering what would be the next miracle.
Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay had been so terribly
scared that she could not disguise it, and
clamored to have not only the duke, but all
the men servants in the hotel to escort her
home. She looked a wreck, did this beautiful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
gayly gowned lady, with her hat in fragments,
her fan broken, her clothes almost torn
off her by the furious, yelling, laughing crowd
of women in the streets. Not so Trimousette,
in her sedate black gown, better suited to
eighty than eighteen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not at all frightened,&#8221; she said to
the duke, and if she had not been so shy, she
would have told him all about it. The coachmen
and footmen did this, however, and slyly,
after the manner of their kind, brought the
duchess&#8217;s calm courage into contrast with
Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay&#8217;s undignified screams
and pleadings.</p>

<p>The duke, who was insensible to fear himself,
expected courage in women, and was
secretly disgusted with Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay.
Besides, like most ladies of her sort, she was
beginning to hound the duke with what she
called her love. It had grown more insistent
since his marriage to the quiet little Trimousette,
who appeared not to know there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
such a thing as faithlessness in the world. The
duke chafed a little under Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay&#8217;s
shameless pursuit of him. Not being a
courageous woman she did not venture into
the streets when the people became turbulent;
but they were not always turbulent, the poor,
starving people. Although herself often afraid
to go out, Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay did not mind
sending out her running footmen, and the
Duke of Belgarde could scarcely leave his
own door without a lackey in Madame de
Valen&ccedil;ay&#8217;s livery poking a scented pink note
at him. The duke ground his teeth, and dimly
recognized that his friend, as he called her,
harassed and worried him, and indeed hen-pecked
him more in two weeks than his pale,
quiet little duchess had done in the whole two
years of their married life. Nevertheless,
Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay&#8217;s glorious and vivid
beauty enchanted him, and made him sometimes
forget Trimousette&#8217;s very existence.
He even forgot to compliment her little feet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
which Trimousette still, with a faint, foolish
hope in her heart, dressed in charming little
shoes, the only patch of coquetry or vanity
about her.</p>

<p>The people, meanwhile, were growing more
and more unruly, and at last one day a mob
of dressmakers, washerwomen, cooks, and the
like, headed by a tall, red-faced laundress, almost
as fierce as the old Countess of Floramour,
began a round of domiciliary visits to
persons who owed them money. They went
to many hotels, including that of Madame de
Valen&ccedil;ay, who ordered all the doors to be
double locked, and ran up to her bedroom,
where she remained cowering and terrified,
but unable to escape the menaces and shouts
of the crowd of haggard, savage women in
the courtyard, demanding their money to keep
their children from starving. They got nothing,
however.</p>

<p>Next, they visited the old Countess of
Floramour, who came down boldly enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
them, but gave them a sermon instead of
money. She exhorted them to live by Bible
texts, and was indignant when the big red-faced
laundress replied that they could neither
eat nor wear the Bible. Thence the riotous
women invaded the courtyard of the splendid
H&ocirc;tel de Belgarde. They had grown more
noisy and the <i>dames de compagnie</i> of the
duchess begged her not to go down to them.
But Trimousette was of all things least a
coward, and taking from her escritoire the
little bag of gold she had saved up to pay
Victor&#8217;s debts, descended the grand staircase
into the sunny courtyard, where the mob
clamored and abused the powdered and silk-stockinged
footmen. Something in the aspect
of this pale, soft-eyed little duchess in her
black gown, her hair tied with a black ribbon,
moved the wild hearts of these savage women,
and her voice, trembling and embarrassed,
made them keep quiet in order to hear her.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all I have,&#8221; she said, blushing and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
stammering as she handed the bag to the big
red laundress; &#8220;it is only a little more than
three hundred louis, and is not enough to pay
you. If I had any more, I would be glad to
give it to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd of women looked at her in surprise;
she was the first great lady they had
visited so far who had given them a franc.
The fierce laundress became almost civil when
she took the bag from Trimousette&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ask for our money, for we are starving.
My little child died last week because
I have not for a year past had money enough
to give her good food. What do you think
of that, madame?&#8221; she cried, her red face suddenly
growing pale and fiercer.</p>

<p>&#8220;My little child died last year,&#8221; answered
Trimousette, looking at the woman before her
with the kinship of motherhood; and then covering
her face with her hands, she burst into
weeping.</p>

<p>The mob was hungry and savage and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
ragged and hated duchesses in general, but
at the sight of the tears of this black-robed,
pale young girl they remained silent. The
washerwoman wiped her eyes with her apron,
laid her hand on the arm of the weeping
duchess, and said roughly:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is like this with all of us, we women,
duchesses and washerwomen alike. Every
one of us has a little pair of wooden shoes, or
a cap, or something that belonged to a dead
child. But ours died because we could not buy
them enough to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little duchess wept again at this, but
presently drying her eyes, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do all I can to pay you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trimousette did not think it necessary to
mention this adventure to the duke. She did
not see him every day even when he was in
Paris, and besides, when she tried to tell him
things, she always grew frightened and the
words died upon her lips. The servants, however,
told the duke of it when he came home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
in the evening. He had spent most of the intervening
time trying to quiet Madame de
Valen&ccedil;ay, who was in paroxysms of terror.
The duke grew every day more bored by his
friend, and concluded to spend the evening at
home, in order to escape Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay
and her scoundrelly running footmen, who
watched his comings and goings as if he were
a criminal.</p>

<p>For the third or fourth time since his marriage
he sought, of his own free will, his
wife&#8217;s society. She spent her evenings in a
little room on the ground floor of the H&ocirc;tel
de Belgarde which opened upon the garden.
When Trimousette heard the duke&#8217;s knock,
she thought it was Victor&#8217;s and ran to open
the door. The sight of her husband disconcerted
her so that she stopped and hesitated
awkwardly, quite unlike Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay,
who could not be awkward if she
tried.</p>

<p>Diane, the broken-legged hound, who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Trimousette&#8217;s constant companion, licked the
duke&#8217;s hand, and gave a soft whine of delight.
Trimousette, whose heart fluttered whenever
she saw her husband, was undemonstrative
and inarticulate. The duke, after politely
greeting his duchess, and patting Diane&#8217;s
head, walked to the fireplace, where a little
blaze crackled. The time was September, and
there was an autumn sharpness in the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid you were alarmed to-day by
that mob of wretched women,&#8221; said the duke
presently, as he warmed his hands at the fire,
the mantel mirror reflecting his handsome
face and figure.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Trimousette timidly, &#8220;I was
not frightened.&#8221;</p>

<p>The duke stroked his chin reflectively. Silent
women like his duchess were sometimes
preferable to those who shrieked and screamed
at the least provocation, like his friend Madame
de Valen&ccedil;ay.</p>

<p>Having said so much Trimousette picked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
up her embroidery frame and, seating herself,
began to embroider. The duke, looking at
her, congratulated himself that she had lost
the habit of blushing and starting every time
he spoke to her, which, for a while after his
marriage, made him apprehend that she might
fall in love with him and that would have been
excessively annoying. Meanwhile, Trimousette&#8217;s
heart was palpitating faintly, and her
black eyes were cast down because she was
too embarrassed to look up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said the duke, &#8220;it would be as
well to go to the Ch&acirc;teau de Belgarde a little
earlier this year.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was thinking that he must get away for
a time from Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay&#8217;s cursed
running footmen perpetually chasing him with
her pink notes. Trimousette felt a sudden
access of courage, which nerved her to say,
almost boldly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Would it not be pleasanter to go to
Boury?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>&#8220;That little dungeon in Brittany!&#8221; cried
the duke, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is so quiet and peaceful there,&#8221; continued
Trimousette, blushing at her own boldness.
&#8220;I think I&mdash;I&mdash;should like to go to
Boury.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the first time since their marriage
that she had ever proffered a request; and the
duke, like most imperial masters, was sometimes
capable of a generous action. Besides,
it occurred to him that Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay
would scarcely follow him to Boury.</p>

<p>All at once, while the duke stood hesitating,
the duchess&#8217;s shyness vanished for one brief
moment, and she became positively eloquent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know all about it,&#8221; she said, clasping
her hands eagerly; &#8220;it is by the sea, and there
is a garden running to the cliffs, with plants
so hardy that even the fierce sea winds cannot
kill them. And there are beautiful woods and
fields, and you&mdash;I&mdash;we could read in the
mornings, and in the afternoons you could go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
out with your fowling piece, and in the evenings&mdash;&#8221;
She stopped, trembling and quite unable
to put into words the enchanting dream
that rose before her. The quiet evenings t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te
with the duke, he reading perhaps&mdash;he
sometimes read the works of Monsieur Voltaire
and Monsieur Rousseau. And she would
sit by working at her tambour frame, with
Diane, her faithful friend and sympathizer, at
her feet. The vision that hovered in Trimousette&#8217;s
mind was not reflected in the duke&#8217;s.
He only saw that his quiet little duchess
wished very much to go to Boury, and had
made the longest and boldest speech he had
ever heard from her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, madame,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I will consider
what you say. At all events, we will
leave Paris, and possibly we may dwell, like
a pair of turtle doves in a cage, for the space
of a week at Boury.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the duke went out, banging the door
after him, Trimousette actually danced about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
the room in her joy and triumph. She would
have him at the little country place all to herself,
and for one whole week. There would
be no brazen intrusion of Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay,
and perhaps&mdash;perhaps the duke might
forget her; and then would come true that
dream of the honeymoon&mdash;for Trimousette
had never had a honeymoon.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS rosy vision of Boury with
her duke lasted Trimousette
just twenty-four hours. The
duke, on reflection, concluded
that Boury was too far away
from Paris, where all was tumult and uncertainty.
It was not too far away from Madame
de Valen&ccedil;ay, of whom the duke was
now almost weary, but for him to go to Brittany
might look as if he were running away
from their Majesties, who were in very great
danger. So, the next evening, the duke again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
came into Trimousette&#8217;s little room and told
her it was not Boury to which they would go,
but Belgarde, near to Versailles. He even
condescended to give his reasons. Trimousette
listened with a mute, unmoved face.
She was so used to disappointments that she
took them without protest. Of course, she
thought the real reason was Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay,
and when the duke left the room, she
went and looked at herself in the mirror.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Trimousette,&#8221; she said to herself,
&#8220;you are not pretty; your eyes are dark, and
you have long, soft, black hair, and little feet.
But that is not beauty. Nor is the love of the
most splendid duke in France for you, although
you may be his wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>The duke invited a great party to spend
the week at the ch&acirc;teau, and the little duchess
went soberly through her duties as hostess.
Everybody said she was much too quiet,
which was true. Others said she had no
feeling, which was ridiculously false.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>The party was very gay. The world was
rapidly turning upside down. Nobody had
any money, the black clouds and red lightnings
and earthquake shocks were bewildering men&#8217;s
minds, so the only thing to do was to laugh,
to dance, to sing.</p>

<p>That is what the company at the Ch&acirc;teau
de Belgarde did, the duke leading all the wild
spirits in the party.</p>

<p>The one comfort the little duchess had was
that her brother Victor was among the roysterers.
He was ever kind to her, but like
her husband, a trifle careless. Victor was
working night and day at a little play, to be
produced in the private theatre at Belgarde.
It was meant to shadow forth the final triumph
of the aristocracy over the people, who
were making themselves to be seen and heard
and felt at every turn. The play was to
be produced on the night before the party
broke up.</p>

<p>Now, it was the fixed and grim determination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
of the duke that Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay
should not track him to Belgarde, to worry
him. But the lady was too clever for him.
He could not prevent her from visiting a
neighboring ch&acirc;teau, and coming over with a
large party to spend the day at Belgarde, as
country neighbors do everywhere.</p>

<p>Never had Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay looked
more deliciously seductive than on that day.
She might have sat for one of Botticelli&#8217;s
nymphs in her soft wine draperies without a
hoop, being in the country, her long fair hair
in curls about her shoulders, and wearing a
hat crowned with roses.</p>

<p>In contrast to this dazzling creature was
the pale little duchess sombrely dressed, her
silence, which verged on awkwardness, placing
her at the greatest disadvantage beside
the brilliant, rippling talk of Madame de
Valen&ccedil;ay and her laughter like the music of
a fountain.</p>

<p>In one thing only did the duchess carry off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
the palm. Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay, like a peacock,
was all beauty except her feet, which
were large and ill-shaped. The duchess&#8217;s
small, arched feet looked smaller than ever in
the dainty black shoes with black silk stockings
which she wore.</p>

<p>Trimousette had shown no sign of chagrin
when Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay arrived with a
merry party, all laughing and chattering like
so many birds in spring. It was a part of her
reticent pride to make no complaint, to show
no uneasiness. The duke was furiously angry
with Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay for hunting him
down, but she was so beautiful, she tripped
up and down the terrace with such airy grace,
she was so wickedly merry at his expense,
that, manlike, he forgave her.</p>

<p>This week, which Trimousette had pictured
to herself as so charming, turned out to be
one of the most trying of her life. She
scarcely saw her duke except in the evening
when the saloons were full of persons, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
there was much fiddling and dancing. Nor
did she see much more of Victor, who was
keen about his play. The very last evening
of all it was produced and was a huge success.
By some sort of hocus-pocus, Madame
de Valen&ccedil;ay had forced herself into the cast,
and made a divinely beautiful marquise, to
whom the duke, as a soldier of fortune, made
violent love and made it well, too, his duchess
looking on with a face composed, almost dull.
Victor himself was disguised most bewitchingly
as a ragpicker, and in his character denounced
the aristocracy furiously, to the uproarious
delight of his audience.</p>

<p>It was the most amusing thing in the world,
and all the fine ladies and gentlemen nearly
died of laughing at it. The heart of the young
duchess alone did not respond to this ridicule
of the earthquakes and the storm clouds. She
remembered the words of the washerwomen
and the cooks, and the strange glare in their
eyes and their pinched faces.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>The gayety of the party lasted until midnight,
when the ball after the play and the
supper was nearly over. Then a messenger,
pale and breathless with hard riding from
Paris, arrived on a spent horse, and told how
the people had gone to Versailles and had
carried the king and queen and their children
and Madame Elizabeth off to Paris. How
the king, foolish and shamefaced, had appeared
on the balcony of the Tuileries with
the red cap of liberty on his head, and how
the royal people were no better than prisoners
in that palace, and that Paris had gone mad.</p>

<p>There were no cowards among this party
at the Ch&acirc;teau of Belgarde except Madame
de Valen&ccedil;ay. Much as she loved the duke,
she loved her own skin better, and privately
resolved to seek shelter in England until the
shower was over, not knowing it to be the
deluge.</p>

<p>The duke, who had not a drop of coward&#8217;s
blood in him, started for Paris at daylight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
He took his duchess with him, not that he
particularly cared for her society, but because
it did not enter his rash head that anybody
should be afraid of anything. So to Paris
they went, and on the next night the duke
was visited by a deputation of rapscallions
calling themselves the National Guard, thrust
into a wretched hackney coach with a ruffian
on each side of him, and cast into the prison
of the Temple as a conspirator against the
liberties of the people.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was one thing to catch the
Duke of Belgarde and another
thing to keep him. Exactly
one week from the night of his
arrest and imprisonment he
was once more at large, and all through the
courage, resource, and seductive powers of
his quiet, sombre-eyed, shrinking young wife.
Trimousette under a sharp spur became articulate,
and the latent vast energy and spirit
she possessed was instantly developed by blows
and hammerings as sparks are struck from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
the dull black flint. The night of the duke&#8217;s
arrest Trimousette shed not one tear on parting
with the man she loved. The duke
thought her rather insensate and would have
relished a few tears from her. Nevertheless,
Trimousette straightway set her wits, which
were not inconsiderable, to work in order to
help her husband. She determined to see him.
Dressing herself in her simplest gown, for she
accorded best with the note of simplicity, and
going straight to Marat, the most hideous and
abominable of men, she sweetly and calmly
asked him to permit her to see her husband for
one half hour to settle some family affairs.
Marat thought he had never seen a simpler,
more democratic young person than this little
duchess. He was very artfully flattered by
Trimousette, who had little or no experience
in that line, but who being all a woman, succeeded
admirably at the first attempt. Marat,
admiring Trimousette&#8217;s large black eyes,
agreed to do what he could. These eyes, usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
so tragic, assumed a smiling and brilliant
expression as soon as Trimousette was
brought face to face with danger. Within
twenty-four hours after her meeting with
Marat, she was admitted to an interview with
her husband in the prison of the Temple.</p>

<p>Of course she was searched on entering and
leaving the prison. It was an ordeal which
brought most great ladies to tears and reproaches,
but Trimousette bore it with something
that savored both of dignity and coquetry,
and actually smiled when the ruffians
who searched her complimented her charming
little feet. They did not observe, around
the bottom of her petticoat, yards and yards
of flat silk braid, which made really a good
strong rope, nor did they discover, hidden
in her thick black hair, some gold pieces.
When she was admitted to the cell of the
duke, he was the most surprised man in Paris,
and more so still when Trimousette, having
suddenly found a very eloquent tongue, laid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
before him a clever plan of escape, along with
all the braid she was ripping off her petticoat
and the money out of her hair. The duke
thought he knew women&mdash;certainly he had
seen a great deal of them ever since he
was a pretty page at the court of Louis
the Fifteenth. But he had not been much
in the way of knowing true love, nor the
magic which it works in the heart of a
woman.</p>

<p>He gazed at his wife with something like
admiration for the first time, and was very
gallant to her, kissing her hand. Trimousette
did not now mistake gallantry for love. She
had grown wise upon disappointments. She
remained a short half hour, and then proudly,
for all her humility, would not wait to be notified,
but left her husband&#8217;s cell, bidding him
good-by again without a tear. Certainly the
duke shed no tears. He was deeply grateful
to his wife and profoundly astonished at the
new attitude she assumed. Immediately he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
busied himself with the schemes for his escape
planned by his wife.</p>

<p>Three nights later, just before daylight, he
dropped out of his prison window into the
garden of the Temple, and scampered off, the
sentry very obligingly turning his back until
the duke was well out of sight.</p>

<p>Great was the hue and cry raised after the
Duke of Belgarde. No suspicion attached to
his little duchess, who was then on her way
to the small castle on the Breton coast. True,
she had seen the duke, but those who knew
about these things, or thought they did, declared
that she was too timid, too silent, too
young to assist in the bold plan of escape
which had freed her husband.</p>

<p>Trimousette arrived at Boury under instructions
from the duke to remain there until
she should get further directions from him.
She reckoned upon remaining a month; and
stayed three years and a half.</p>

<p>Never in the same space of time had so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
much happened in any country as in France
from 1789 to 1794. The old order that had
lasted a thousand years was engulfed, and
black chaos reigned. The little duchess in
the old stone castle by the sea heard the reverberating
thunders, and felt the earth rocking
under her feet, and saw the crashing wreck of
monarchy. She stirred not, having been told
to remain tranquilly at Boury until her lord
should send her word otherwise. The duke
was in the thick of the tumult and was in
danger every hour of the day and night. He
was sometimes a fugitive for his life; again
he appeared boldly in Paris and defied arrest.
He was not one of those who would have
saved poor Louis the Sixteenth and Marie
Antoinette by flight. On the contrary, being
of inextinguishable courage, he advised using
the strong hand, and would have had Louis
the Sixteenth show something of the spirit of
Henry the Fourth. The thing which Fernand,
Duke of Belgarde, hated most was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
cowardice, and through this was he absolved
from the spell of Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay. She
had fled to England and never ceased importuning
the duke by letter to run away from
France. The duke on reading these letters
would dash them under foot and trample upon
them in his fury. Nor would he answer them,
considering himself insulted by them. This
did not keep Madame de Valen&ccedil;ay from writing
them, because, unlike Trimousette, she
was without pride.</p>

<p>The duke made the handsomest possible
thanks to his duchess for her share in his
escape, and really meant to show his appreciation
of the fact that she was the only
woman who had ever helped him and never
bothered him. But too much was happening;
rivers of blood were flowing everywhere, and
only those things which were insistent made
any impression on the duke, and Trimousette
was the least insistent person on earth.</p>

<p>Nothing more unlike the sweet dream which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
Trimousette had planned for Boury could be
imagined than the life she led there for more
than three years. She was quite alone, except
for her <i>dame de compagnie</i>, a sour old
lady of whom Trimousette was mortally
afraid. True, she had with her Diane, the
broken-legged hound, now blind and scarcely
able to creep at Trimousette&#8217;s heel when the
two walked together upon the rocky shore at
sunset to dream of the absent one. For Trimousette
felt sure Diane dreamed of her beautiful,
brilliant master. In the long evenings
spent in the gloomy old saloon Trimousette
would take in her hands Diane&#8217;s trembling
paws and whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;Diane, do you think he ever remembers
us? Do you think he will ever send for us?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Diane would give a melancholy whine,
indicating that she did not believe the duke
ever would. Sure enough the duke did not
send for either his wife or his dog, and poor
Diane, weary of waiting, at last lay down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
quietly one night by Trimousette&#8217;s bed and
was found dead next morning.</p>

<p>Trimousette felt more alone than ever in
her life when the poor lame dog was dead.
Soon after, she got news that Madame de
Floramour had died of chagrin at the disasters
and irreligion into which France was
plunged; and last&mdash;ah, cruel stroke!&mdash;Victor
fell fighting gallantly in La Vend&eacute;e.</p>

<p>The young duchess bore these blows in
patience and silence. The duke managed to
contrive a letter of sympathy to his duchess
when the soul of Victor de Floramour was
called away. The letter was very ill-spelled
and ill-written, for the duke&#8217;s accomplishments
were those of Henry the Fourth&mdash;he
could drink, he could fight, and he could be
gallant to the ladies, but he could not write,
although he could think excellently well. Trimousette
treasured this rude scrawl. It was
the nearest to a love letter she had ever received
from any man.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the long days and months
and years Trimousette spent
at Boury she was forced to
employ herself. She had no
great taste for books beyond
books of poetry, but she practiced on the
cracked harpsichord which had belonged to
the duke&#8217;s mother, and she developed a pretty
little voice in which she sang to herself songs
of love and longing. One day, during the
winter of 1794, Trimousette got some news
from Paris. Queen Marie Antoinette had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
followed King Louis to the guillotine, and the
Duke of Belgarde was once more in the prison
of the Temple. He got there by one of the
few acts of stupidity he ever committed in his
life. He had slipped into Paris after the execution
of Queen Marie Antoinette, determined
to save the little Dauphin if the wit of man
and the sacrifice of many lives could contrive
it. Then came in the stupidity. This duke,
who could do everything superlatively well
except to write and spell, undertook to pass
himself off as a schoolmaster! Moreover, he
wore a shabby brocade coat, the last remnant
of his wardrobe. Robespierre and St. Just
then had France by the throat and were wolfishly
devouring her children. It did not take
them long to discover that this schoolmaster
who could not spell was Fernand, Duke of
Belgarde, and they promptly clapped him into
prison. For those unfortunates imprisoned by
these two men there was but one exit and that
was in the arms of Madame Guillotine, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
held a well-attended court at sunset every day
in the Place de la R&eacute;volution.</p>

<p>Within a fortnight Trimousette heard this
grim news of her husband. It was February,
the ground was covered with snow, and for a
duchess to go to Paris was like putting one&#8217;s
head in the lion&#8217;s mouth. All this was urged
upon Trimousette by her <i>dame de compagnie</i>.
It had no more effect upon her than the soft
falling snow upon the Breton rocks. Before
midnight on the day she heard the heartbreaking
news Trimousette was on her way to
Paris. She was not in her own ducal traveling
chariot, but in the common <i>diligence</i>, for
this inexperienced creature seemed gifted
with a kind of prescience, nay, a genius of
common sense, which stood her in place of
actual knowledge of the world. She traveled
as Madame Belgarde, wisely dropping the <i>de</i>,
and absolutely alone, refusing even to take a
maid.</p>

<p>Three days afterwards, on a March morning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
Robespierre, the apostle of murder, had
just finished arraying himself in the sky-blue
coat and cream-colored breeches which he
loved, when a lady was announced in the
anteroom. Robespierre loved the society of
ladies, and one of the privileges of his position
as chief murderer was the sight of dainty
women prostrate before him, begging and imploring
him for the lives of their husbands,
fathers, or sons.</p>

<p>The lady in this case neither prostrated
herself, nor begged, nor implored. She was
quite calm and self-possessed, and although
not beautiful had fine black eyes. After
making Robespierre a charming curtsey, she
said, smiling:</p>

<p>&#8220;Citizen Robespierre, I am Citizeness Belgarde,
once known as the Duchess of Belgarde,
and I have come to ask that I be
admitted to share the imprisonment of my
husband, once Duke of Belgarde.&#8221;</p>

<p>Robespierre, who dearly loved a duchess,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
motioned Trimousette to be seated, then said
in his croaking voice after a moment:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no doubt your husband has conspired
against the liberties of the people, and
the only way in which those liberties can be
secured is by the death of all those who would
have destroyed liberty, like that tyrant Louis
Capet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, thought Robespierre, she will begin
to sob and beg for her husband&#8217;s life. But
not so. Trimousette reflected a moment, and
then said, softly and clearly:</p>

<p>&#8220;The killing of his Most Christian Majesty
and of the blessed Queen Marie Antoinette
was barbarous murder.&#8221;</p>

<p>Robespierre started violently. No man,
much less a woman, had dared before to say
so much to him. He looked with scowling
green eyes at Trimousette composed and even
smiling slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The National Assembly long since decreed
the death of all who should advance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
such treason,&#8221; he said, as soon as he could
catch breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I supposed,&#8221; replied Trimousette;
&#8220;but if I can but be allowed in my husband&#8217;s
prison&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A light leaped into her black eyes as she
spoke. Robespierre, stroking his chin, regarded
her critically. How would she go to
the guillotine? Probably quite quietly, without
making the least outcry of resistance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Citizen Robespierre,&#8221; said Trimousette,
rising and coming toward him, &#8220;surely,
you cannot refuse the request of a lady. I
came to you not only because you have all
power, but because I knew you to be gallant&mdash;a
gentleman, in short.&#8221;</p>

<p>So said the most sincere of women glancing
at Robespierre with a look dangerously
near to coquetry as well as flattery, and
nobody had ever suspected this taciturn woman
of being either a coquette or a flatterer.
Yet, being a woman, she could be both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
coquette and flatterer for the man she loved.
What perjuries will women commit for love!
Robespierre reflected and Trimousette smiled.
He spoke and she answered him with soft,
insinuating words; and at last she got out of
him the written commitment, charging her,
too, with conspiring against the liberties of
the people, and condemning her to be imprisoned
with her husband, Citizen Fernand
Belgarde, in the prison of the Temple.</p>

<p>Trimousette almost laughed aloud with joy
when this grim document was made out, and
again gave Robespierre a bewitching little
curtsey, such as the most finished coquette
might have done. She climbed joyfully into
the dirty cab with the dirtier gendarmes who
were to deliver her to the jailers in the Temple.</p>

<p>It was a mild March afternoon when he
who had once been Duke of Belgarde sat at
his prison window, looking down into the
dreary old garden of the Temple. The window
was semicircular, reaching from the floor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
half way to the low ceiling, and gave not
much of sun or even light. The duke was
thinking, strangely enough, of his duchess.
She was a good little thing; shy, but not a
born coward like the Valen&ccedil;ay woman&mdash;nay,
somewhat indifferent to danger and, for a
woman, averse from shrieking and screaming,
but timid in her attitude toward life. She
had certainly showed some ingenuity in forwarding
his escape three years and a half
ago. The duke had made up his mind upon
his arrest that there was not much chance
of a duke and peer of France escaping the
guillotine, and so quite coolly accepted the
certainty that his name would soon be in the
list which was posted up every morning, of
those for whom the tumbrils would wait at
seven o&#8217;clock in the evening. As his inexpertness
with the pen had got him into his present
plight, the duke determined to remedy that
defect in his education. He had on his incarceration
gravely explained to the turnkey that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
there might not be much use for writing in
purgatory, where he declared all gentlemen
went&mdash;the revolutionists going to eternal
punishment, and the ladies to heaven. Nevertheless,
he meant to improve his handwriting.
On this March afternoon the duke, seated at
a rickety table, was busy practicing his new
accomplishment of writing, when he heard the
door of his cell open behind him. He did not
turn his head. This Citizen Belgarde was a
disdainful fellow, and never saw his jailers
until they stood before him. In spite of this,
and perhaps because of it, he was a favorite
with turnkey Duval, who often frankly expressed
his regret that the day was not far off
when Citizen Belgarde would be started in
a tumbril on his way to the Place de la
R&eacute;volution.</p>

<p>Trimousette, standing just within the door,
which was closed behind her, had a good look
at her duke&mdash;as good, that is, as her fast-beating
heart would permit to her yearning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
tear-filled eyes. Upon his profile, clearly silhouetted
against the window&#8217;s dim light, she
saw the pallor of a prisoner. He still wore
his shabby brocade coat and an embroidered
waistcoat, but both were threadbare and
dingy. His hair, long and curling, was tied
with a black ribbon to distinguish him from
the cropped heads which the revolutionists
affected. But his eyes, the eyes of a fighter,
were undaunted, and his mouth still knew how
to smile. The Duke of Belgarde considered
that he had lost the game of life, and the only
thing left was to pay like a gentleman. As
Trimousette watched, he threw down his pen,
pushed his chair back, cocked his feet upon
the table, and began to whistle quite jovially
&#8220;Vive Henri Quatre.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still he had not looked toward her, and Trimousette&#8217;s
courage, having brought her alone
in night and storm from Brittany, and strongly
sustained her when she went to see Robespierre
of the green eyes and croaking voice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
and got herself condemned to prison upon a
capital charge&mdash;could not carry her the yard
or two between her and her soul&#8217;s desire.</p>

<p>But then the duke turned, recognized her,
rose, and, obeying a sudden impulse, opened
his arms to her. True, he would have rejoiced
to see a dog, even broken-legged Diane,
anything which was connected with the splendid
dream of the past. Yet was the duke
actually glad to see the only woman who could
love him without worrying him.</p>

<p>Trimousette did not fly into his arms. Poor
soul, even at that moment rose the undying
instinct of womanhood not to yield too quickly.
The duke came forward and, by the same
impulse, swept her into his arms. At once, in
the twinkling of an eye, love was born within
him, and he kissed her as a lover for the first
time in their married life. A glory, as of the
morning, rose before Trimousette&#8217;s eyes. She
had lost all, even her life was a forfeit, but
she had gained all&mdash;her husband&#8217;s love.</p>

</div>
<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dropcap_p.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PRESENTLY the first agitation
was past, and Trimousette
told, as if it were the simplest
thing in the world, the story of
her journey alone by <i>diligence</i>
from the Breton coast to Paris, and how she
forced her way into Robespierre&#8217;s presence
and had wrung from him the boon of being
with her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;But let us not deceive ourselves,&#8221; said the
duke gently, still holding her to his breast.
&#8220;I shall not escape from the Temple this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
time. No man has ever got away from this
prison twice. I am destined to follow his
Majesty the King and her Majesty the Queen
to the guillotine.&#8221;</p>

<p>He expected that Trimousette would faint
or shriek when he said this, but she looked at
him with calm eyes and answered in a soft,
unbroken voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;So it may be, but Robespierre has promised
me that when you leave the prison I shall
go with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The duke held her a little way from him
and studied her reflectively. Yes, it was better
so. In a flash had been revealed to him
the height and depth of her adoration. What
would be her fate if left alone among those
howling wolves who now ravened France?
He would have taken with him any creature
that he loved, as he would have saved a
bullet for that creature if he had been surrounded
and overwhelmed by savages, whose
blood thirst must be appeased.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; continued Trimousette, still
smiling and composed, &#8220;let us here await
God&#8217;s will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that of the National Assembly,&#8221;
grimly replied the duke, who had not become
either pious or forgiving under the shadow
of the guillotine, but, like most men, was the
same in all circumstances. Some, however,
mistake fear for repentance&mdash;not so Fernand,
Duke of Belgarde.</p>

<p>There was but one chair, one bed, one table
in the room, and when the turnkey brought
the duke&#8217;s supper, there was only one cup,
one plate, and no spoon or knife at all. To
the turnkey&#8217;s surprise, Citizen and Citizeness
Belgarde made merry at this. Trimousette was
to have a little cell opening into the duke&#8217;s,
but when the rusty door was forced wide,
there was nothing but the bare walls and floor.
The duke, assuming an air of authority as
if he were giving orders to a lackey at the
Ch&acirc;teau de Belgarde, directed the turnkey to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
bring what was necessary for the comfort of
the Duchess of Belgarde, and the turnkey,
appreciating the joke, grinned and winked at
the duke. Then the duchess, in her sweet,
complaisant manner, said to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray, take no offense at the Duke of Belgarde.
He is not yet used to being in prison.
But do me the favor, please, kind sir, to give
me at least a bed to sleep upon and a chair
to sit in. Not so good as your wife has
at home, perhaps, but I shall be easily satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>The turnkey Duval went, and returned
after a few minutes to say that not only might
the duchess have a bed and a chair and a
table, but he would even get an old counterpane
and hang it up as a curtain between the
cells. This was luxury undreamed of by Trimousette,
and she overwhelmed Duval with
pretty thanks. The turnkey of his own accord
put up the bed and placed the chair and
table which all prisoners were allowed, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
having himself a taste for luxury, actually
laid a piece of carpet by the side of the bed
and put a coarse cover on the table.</p>

<p>This prison supper was the first time the
Duke and Duchess of Belgarde had ever
supped together alone with each other. They
felt a furtive and secret joy at being together,
for the duke had been steadily falling in love
with his wife ever since she appeared in his
cell an hour before. He noticed a new expression
in her black eyes, an expression of hope
and even of joy. Trimousette, with a woman&#8217;s
keenness, knew she was on the road to her
kingdom&mdash;her husband&#8217;s heart. It was so odd
that it was almost comical, the way the duke
examined his wife. She certainly had beautiful eyes,
and a slim figure, and although
dressed in the simplest manner, as became a
lady who traveled alone, Trimousette had not
forgotten her solitary piece of coquetry&mdash;her
delicious little shoes. Also, she had suddenly
found her tongue, and talked to her husband so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
freely and even gayly that he was astounded.
Was this the silent, shy, awkward girl he
had married so many years ago and who had
seemed to be growing shyer, more silent, more
awkward every year? He was so surprised,
so pleased, so touched, that he scarcely knew
what to make of it. The sky was still alight
when their supper was over, and Trimousette
produced some needlework which she had
been allowed to bring into the prison. She
was very artful, was this artless Trimousette,
and not meaning to thrust her company on
her husband, retired to her own little cell.
There a charming surprise awaited her. The
turnkey, over whom Trimousette had thrown
a spell of enchantment, had placed upon her
table a pot containing a geranium with ten
leaves and two brilliant scarlet blossoms.
Trimousette, after admiring her treasure, sat
down upon her one chair and began to stitch
diligently by the fading light. She was ever
a good needlewoman. Most prisoners, as soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
as they were incarcerated, begged for pen, ink,
and paper, to write to their friends, and to
begin their struggle to get out of prison. Not
so Trimousette. She had no one to write to,
and particularly did not wish to get out of
prison.</p>

<p>As she sat sewing, she heard the duke moving
restlessly about in the next cell, beyond
the ragged curtain. A mysterious smile came
into Trimousette&#8217;s eyes and upon her lips;
her husband was uneasy without her; he must
come and seek her&mdash;oh, rapturous thought!
Presently, the duke knocked quite timidly at
the side of the door. It might have been Trimousette
herself, the knock was so gentle;
and when Trimousette softly bade him enter,
he said, quite shamefacedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never been lonely in this place
before, for my thoughts, although painful
enough, always kept me busy. But I have
grown very lonely without you in the last five
minutes. May I enter?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>In that hour began Trimousette&#8217;s long-delayed
honeymoon.</p>

<p>Trimousette, being by nature orderly and
the duke philosophic, they regulated their
lives as if they expected to die of old age in
the prison of the Temple. The duke had never
before had much leisure for reading, his time
having been chiefly taken up with war and
the ladies, nor had he felt the need of any
proficiency in writing until he became the
guest of the Revolution. His newly found
accomplishment with the pen revealed to him
a gift which neither he nor anyone else
ever suspected in him. He could write verses,
very pretty verses, all addressed to Trimousette.
These she set to music and sang in a
sweet little voice. Some of these songs were
quite gay and coquettish, and Trimousette
sang them gayly and coquettishly. Thus was
the kingdom of poetry and song opened to
them and they entered it hand in hand. When
they sat together at the rude table in the purple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
April nights, the duke teaching Trimousette
his verses and she singing them softly
to him, they gazed with rapture into each
other&#8217;s eyes, and wondered how they could
ever have lived apart.</p>

<p>They had no watch or clock and no means
of telling the time except by the prison bells,
until the duke contrived, with a wooden peg
driven into the bare table, a rude sundial.
They would not put upon it the motto of the
sundial in the old garden where Trimousette
had first dreamed of the duke; it was too sad.
The duke suggested the old, old one, &#8220;Only
the happy hours I mark,&#8221; but Trimousette
shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are not all our hours happy when we are
together?&#8221; she asked, and her husband for
answer caught her to his breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know another motto,&#8221; she whispered;
&#8220;it is on the sundial on the broken terrace at
Boury, &#8216;&#8217;Tis always morning somewhere in
the world.&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>The duke therefore etched, with a piece of a
nail out of his shoe, this motto upon the table,
and Trimousette said it meant that when they
made their journey some evening to the Place
de la R&eacute;volution, they would close their eyes
for a few minutes and open them upon the
Eternal Morning. She had many sweet superstitions,
but behind them lay a noble courage
and faith itself.</p>

<p>Trimousette was not always employed with
poetry and music, however, but devised for
herself many graceful and feminine employments,
the duke watching her meanwhile with
great delight. In the mornings she, like a
good housewife, would sew with diligence,
and patched and mended the duke beautifully.
Her own wardrobe contained but two gowns,
a black one, which she wore every day, and a
white one, which she saved carefully for a certain
great occasion likely to arrive any day;
for although she and her duke lived in their
two cells with love and peace, neither of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
expected release except by the road which led
to the guillotine in the Place de la R&eacute;volution.
Robespierre had promised it, and in these matters
he never broke his word. They faced the
future with a composure which amazed themselves.
The duke had the courage of a soldier
who is always ready to answer the last
roll call; Trimousette&#8217;s simple and sublime
faith would have made her walk to the stake
as calmly as to the guillotine.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that a
man with red blood in him like Fernand,
Duke of Belgarde, could see a new, sweet life
of love opening before him, and then could
always bring himself to resignation. He said
little when these moods, like slaves in revolt,
possessed him. At such times he would rise
from his bed in the night, grinding his teeth
and quivering with a dumb rage, and walk
stealthily like a cunning madman, up and
down, up and down, his narrow cell. Trimousette
waking, would rise, and going to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
him in the darkness, gently recall him to his
manhood, his fortitude, his heart of a soldier,
and then with the earnestness of an angel and
the simplicity of a child, she would tell him
of the strange certainty she felt that they
would not be separated even in the passage
of the abyss called death. The duke, listening
to her, and feeling the soft clasp of her arm
about his neck, would find something like repose
descend upon his tumultuous soul. At
least, they would go together&mdash;that much of
comfort was theirs. But it was only at times
that this mood came upon the duke. Soldier-like,
he had always looked upon death as an
incident, and the only really important thing
about it was how the thing could be done with
the greatest ease and dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;And surely,&#8221; Trimousette would say,
drawing up her slight figure and showing the
pride that was always alive, but secret in her
heart, &#8220;to die for one&#8217;s loyalty is a very good
way for the Duke and Duchess of Belgarde<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
to make their exit.&#8221; Let no one feel sorry
for Trimousette. She had passed through
the Gate of Tears forever, and was already
in that Garden of All Delight, which men call
Perfect Love.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">EVERY day at noon the prisoners
walked for an hour in the
garden and courtyard of the
Temple. They were quite
cheerful, and sometimes even
gay. Madame Guillotine was grown familiar
to their thoughts. They paid each other compliments
upon their courage, and made little
jokes on very grim subjects. The honeymoon
of the Duke and Duchess of Belgarde
amused, but also touched their fellow prisoners.
Among these was a pretty boy of sixteen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
the Vicomte d&#8217;Aronda. His father had
died, as had Victor, Count of Floramour, gallantly
fighting in La Vend&eacute;e. His mother and
sister had perished in the embrace of Madame
Guillotine. The boy alone remained. He felt
himself every inch a man, and showed more
than a man&#8217;s courage. He was immensely
captivated by the Duke of Belgarde&#8217;s dashing
air, which he still retained in spite of his
patched coat and shabby hat, and when the
duke introduced the little vicomte to Trimousette,
the boy fell, if possible, more in love
with her than with the duke. Every day during
their hour of exercise in the garden he
watched for them, and his boyish face reddened
with pleasure when they would ask him
to join them on their promenade up and down
the broken flags. It diverted the duke to
pretend to be jealous of so gallant a fellow
as the little vicomte, and the boy himself, half
bashful and half saucy, was charmed with the
notion of being treated as a gay dog. Neither<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
the duke nor Trimousette ever spoke to the
boy of the fate that lay before him, as well
as themselves, for he was so young&mdash;but sixteen
years old&mdash;and the soul is not full fledged
at sixteen. One day, however, the lad himself
broached the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, madame and monsieur,&#8221; he
said, quite serenely, &#8220;all the men of my line
have known how to die, whether in their beds
of old age, or falling from their horses in
battle, and I, too, know how to die. I shall
be perfectly easy, and not let the villains who
execute me see that I care anything about it.
My mother died as bravely as the Queen herself;
so did my sister, only twenty years old;
and I shall not disgrace them. But I should
like very much to go the same day with you.
It would seem quite lonely to walk in this
garden without you.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he said this, a woman&#8217;s passion of
pity for the boy overwhelmed Trimousette.
She felt nothing like pity for her own fate or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
that of the man she loved; they had entered
into Paradise before their time, that was all.
But the boy was too young to have had even
a glimpse of that Paradise. At least he
would go in his white-souled youth, and this
thought comforted Trimousette.</p>

<p>So passed the happiest month of Trimousette&#8217;s
life. Her pale cheek grew rosy and
rounded like a child&#8217;s. Her black eyes lost
their tragic and melancholy expression and
now shone with a soft splendor of deep peace
and even joy. Trimousette, Duchess of Belgarde,
had come into her own at last. She received
from her husband the constant tribute
of his adoring and admiring love. When she
glanced up from her sewing, it was to find the
duke&#8217;s eyes lifted from his book or his writing
and fixed upon her. If she moved across
the narrow little cell, he watched her, noting
the grace of her movements. He told her
twenty times a day that she had the most
beautiful, dainty feet in the world. When she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
sang her little songs to him in a small pretty
voice, the duke thought it the most exquisite
melody he had ever heard. They were as far
removed from the world as if they were upon
another planet, and standing on the lonely
peak of existence between the two abysms
from which man emerges and into which he
descends, it was as if they contained in themselves
the universe.</p>

<p>It was now April; the days were long and
bright, and the nights short and brilliant with
moonlight and star shine. One day&mdash;it was
the twenty-first of April&mdash;the air was so warm
and Maylike that Trimousette laid aside her
heavy black gown and put on the only other
one she possessed&mdash;her white one, which she
had saved for her bridal with death. Her
husband had not seen her in a white gown for
a long, long time, and paid her such loverlike
compliments that Trimousette blushed with
delight. When the time came for them to go
into the gardens for their one hour of fresh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
air many of the prisoners remarked upon Trimousette&#8217;s
white gown, and the little Vicomte
d&#8217;Aronda, coming up, said gallantly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame, I beg to present you with a bouquet
I gathered for you this morning,&#8221; and
handed her five puny dandelions and some
milkweed, tied together with a bit of grass.</p>

<p>Trimousette was charmed, and thanked the
boy so prettily that he blushed redder than
ever, and the duke declared the vicomte was
a dangerous fellow with the ladies&mdash;at which
the lad answered saucily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, monsieur, if I could live until I am
grown up! Then I should indeed be devoted
to the ladies.&#8221;</p>

<p>The duke turned away his head. The boy
was but sixteen years old and he would not
live to be much older.</p>

<p>That day was illuminated for Trimousette;
it was so softly bright. As the afternoon wore
on, its languid beauty, its sad sweetness entered
into the soul of Trimousette. She did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
not busy herself as usual with the little tasks
she had devised for herself, but sat and moved
in a soft and composed reverie. Then, for a
long time she watched the rude sundial, studying
the motto, and, almost involuntarily, she
wrote upon the table with her pen the old
motto about the passing of the shadows called
man. She was serious, but not sad, and when
the duke, taking her hand, said to her:</p>

<p>&#8220;My little Trimousette, does your heart
ache because we, shadows that we are, shall
no more pass this way?&#8221; Trimousette replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you truly, my heart has not once
ached for myself since I have been in this
prison.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with a lovely sidelong glance from her
black eyes, now no longer sad, she continued,
smiling:</p>

<p>&#8220;We have had our honeymoon, and no
price can be too dear for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the hundredth time the duke begged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
her pardon for those early years of neglect,
and Trimousette, answering his burning
kisses, whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;It does not matter now. All the great
joys and griefs color the past as well as the
present. Since you were to love me, I could
wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>The perfect day had a sunset of unearthly
beauty. Together at the low-arched window
in the great prison wall Trimousette and her
best beloved watched the rosy sunset glow
give way to the keen flashing stars shining in
the deep blue heavens. They talked a little,
softly, but presently an eloquent silence fell
between them. Trimousette&#8217;s head was upon
her husband&#8217;s shoulder, and after a time she
slept. The duke drew her mantle about her
and held her close. And thus, in warmth and
peace and love, Trimousette slept an hour.
It was close upon nine o&#8217;clock and a great
vivid moon flooded the little cell with its silvery
radiance when the duke heard the key<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
turning quietly in the heavy lock. Duval, the
turnkey, entered, and obeying a sign from the
duke, walked noiselessly toward him. The
turnkey&#8217;s coarse face was pale, and his rough
hands shook. He said in a whisper to the
duke:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is to-morrow&mdash;at seven in the evening&mdash;sunset
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The duke nodded coolly. The hour being
at hand he was all courage.</p>

<p>The turnkey pointed to the sleeping Trimousette,
then turned away putting his sleeve
to his face. Trimousette stirred, and withdrawing
herself from the duke&#8217;s arm, looked
with calm, wide-open eyes from her husband
to the turnkey and back again. In the strong
white moonlight she saw clearly the faces of
both men.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is to-morrow, I think,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is to-morrow,&#8221; replied the duke, without a tremor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur Robespierre&mdash;&#8221; began the turnkey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
and then in terror and rage stopped,
shaking his fist in the direction of the Rue St.
Honor&eacute;, where Robespierre lodged.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all, it is well to leave a feast before
the candles are burned out,&#8221; said the duke,
smiling, and Trimousette added:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not Monsieur Robespierre. It is the
will of the good God who calls us, and we
pass over the short bridge, not the long one
of age and disease, but the shortest of all&mdash;and
we pass together.&#8221;</p>

<p>The turnkey kept on in a shaking voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a soul but you knows who is to be
posted to-morrow, but I can tell you of two&mdash;the
sister of Louis Capet, Madame Elizabeth,
and the little boy who calls himself Vicomte
d&#8217;Aronda, and saunters about the garden so
jauntily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a great honor to us that we go with
the King&#8217;s sister, and as for the little lad&mdash;well,
he has no father, no mother, no brother,
no sister&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>It was the duke who said this. Trimousette
had never shown something like weakness
about the boy, and, falling back in her chair,
struck her hands together with a gesture of
anguish.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE night in its pale glory passed,
and the morning dawned as
fair as if the world were freshly
made. The duke waited
until seven o&#8217;clock for Trimousette
to wake; she had slept like an infant
since midnight. Then he went and roused
her. She arose and dressed quickly, and began
those preparations which even the poorest
prisoner makes before leaving the world.
There were some books to be disposed of
and a few clothes, and the pot with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
geranium, now bearing three splendid scarlet
flowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well you have no shoes to leave, except
what you are wearing, for there is no
woman&#8217;s foot in France small enough for
your shoes,&#8221; said the duke, with an air of
compliment, and Trimousette nodded almost
gayly.</p>

<p>At nine o&#8217;clock Duval came to them. The
duke was calmly writing at his table, and
Trimousette was smoothing out her white
gown upon the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Monsieur Duval,&#8221; she cried cheerfully,
&#8220;we have decided to make you our
executor. The duke means to leave you his
pen and these books. You can sell the books
for ten francs perhaps. My clothes are few
and very shabby, but you may have a daughter
or perhaps a niece whom they will fit, so
pray take them. Also, I give you my geranium,
but I shall pluck the blossoms&mdash;one for
the duke to wear to the Place de la R&eacute;volution,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
one for myself, and one for the little
Vicomte d&#8217;Aronda.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, madame,&#8221; replied Duval
gruffly. &#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;have not yet told the boy.
I don&#8217;t know how he will take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have no fear. His name is d&#8217;Aronda,&#8221;
said the duke, looking up from his writing.</p>

<p>At noon the great doors clanged open, and
the prisoners, marching out, saw the list of
the condemned posted up in the vast, gloomy
archway. The list, which was long, was headed
with the name of the King&#8217;s sister, the
gentle and pious Elizabeth. Next came the
names of Citizen and Citizeness Belgarde, and
the twenty-fourth and last name was that of
Louis Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric d&#8217;Aronda.</p>

<p>At this noontime, as on any other, Trimousette
and the duke walked in the garden.
They wished to say good-by to their friends
among their fellow prisoners, a brave custom,
rarely omitted. As the duke and Trimousette
passed out into the gloomy corridor, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
saw, standing before the posted list in the
archway, the little vicomte, quite smiling and
composed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a great honor,&#8221; he said, bowing low
with boyish bravado, &#8220;to go with the King&#8217;s
sister, and also an honor to go with the Duke
and Duchess of Belgarde.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Death is nothing,&#8221; cried the duke debonairly,
laying his hand on the lad&#8217;s shoulder.
&#8220;I have faced him a hundred times in fight,
and if you look him straight in the eye and
advance upon him, he grows quite amiable to
look at.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So my father always said,&#8221; replied the
boy, &#8220;and none of my family, monsieur, knew
fear. Even my sister, only twenty, was as
cool as any soldier, and surely a gentleman
cannot let his sister surpass him in valor. Oh,
if I die bravely, my father will praise me, and
my mother will smile upon me, and so will
my sister when we meet; and if I show the
white feather, I should be afraid to face them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>&#8220;You shall go in the cart with us,&#8221; said
Trimousette, &#8220;and we will tell Madame
Elizabeth that you are a brave boy, a real
d&#8217;Aronda.&#8221;</p>

<p>That day, too, was bright and cloudless,
and one of the most peaceful Trimousette
ever spent.</p>

<p>At six o&#8217;clock there resounded through the
great stone corridors of the prison a loud,
echoing voice, calling the condemned to appear,
and at the same moment the tumbrils
rattled into the courtyard. Duval unlocked the
doors of the cells, and the Duke and Duchess
of Belgarde came forth, and at the same
moment the little vicomte appeared. He
had made as much of a toilet as he could, and
carried carefully in his hand a new, though
coarse, white handkerchief.</p>

<p>Trimousette wore upon the breast of her
white gown a vivid red geranium blossom,
and another blazed upon the lapel of the
duke&#8217;s threadbare brocade coat. The third<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
blossom Trimousette pinned upon the little
vicomte&#8217;s breast, and he kissed her hand for it.</p>

<p>Once in the courtyard, the guards objected
to the boy going in the same cart with Trimousette
and her husband&mdash;the cart would be
too heavy.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he is so small&mdash;he takes up so little
room,&#8221; urged Trimousette, with soft pleading
in her eyes. And then, the lad, without waiting
for permission, jumped into the cart and
folded his arms defiantly, as much as to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn me out if you dare.&#8221;</p>

<p>They allowed him to remain.</p>

<p>There were twelve tumbrils in all for the
twenty-four condemned persons. The very
last to appear was a gentle, middle-aged lady,
the dead King&#8217;s sister, Madame Elizabeth.
Each of the condemned persons made her a
low bow, the little vicomte scrambling out
of the cart to make his reverence. The eyes
of Madame Elizabeth grew troubled as she
looked at the lad; the women and men could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
die, but the little lads&mdash;ah, it was too hard!
The Duke of Belgarde, as the man of highest
rank present, had the honor of assisting Madame
Elizabeth into the cart, for which she
thanked him sweetly. Her hands were the
first tied, the guards knowing well she would
make no resistance, and that the rest would
do as the King&#8217;s sister did. When it came to
the duke&#8217;s turn, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you kindly permit me to assist madame,
my wife, into the cart first? Then I
shall submit willingly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ruffian in attendance assented with a
grin, and the duke gallantly helped Trimousette
into the tumbril, and then putting his
hands behind his back, they were tied, after
which he jumped lightly in himself and cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Drive on, coachman! Straight ahead,
first turning to the right!&#8221;</p>

<p>The procession of the twelve carts moved.
In one sat a solitary person, in another sat
three, the Duke and Duchess de Belgarde and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
the young Vicomte d&#8217;Aronda. The evening
was as clear as crystal and the river, like a
string of pearls, slipped softly from the green
valley of the Seine, under the bridges, the
statues looking down upon the silvery stream,
past the palaces, in whose windows the sunset
blazed blood red. The great city was still
and breathless, as it always was when these
strange processions started for the great open
space where Madame Guillotine held her
court. Toward the west, the sky turned from
a flame of crimson to an ocean of golden light,
and then to a splendor of pale purple and
green and rose. Presently, a single palpitating
star came out softly in the heavens, now
dark blue, and shone with a veiled but steady
brilliance, growing larger and brighter as the
daylight waned. Trimousette, jolting along
upon the rude plank laid crosswise the tumbril,
leaned a little toward the duke, who, although
pinioned, yet supported her as the
cart rattled along the stony street. The boy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
sat at her feet, his look fixed upon her face.
He saw neither fear nor grief, but perfect
peace. From Trimousette the lad turned his
glance upon the duke, who had a cool and
victorious eye even in that hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said a great many prayers last night,&#8221;
said the boy, after a pause, &#8220;and so that business
is finished. I leave all with God, as a
gentleman should who treats God as if He
were a gentleman and meant to keep His word
to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will keep His word to us,&#8221; answered
Trimousette. The boy&#8217;s courage charmed her,
and she thought, if long life had been given to
her she would have wished for such a son as
this Louis Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric d&#8217;Aronda.</p>

<p>&#8220;When first I was in prison I rehearsed
this scene to myself and concluded there was
nothing about it to keep a man awake at
night,&#8221; said the duke. &#8220;I think with you,
my young vicomte, if there is a God, He is
a gentleman, and will treat us poor devils of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
mortals fairly. Is not that true, Trimousette?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite true,&#8221; replied Trimousette.</p>

<p>So, with calm and peaceful talk, they made
the journey, amid crowds of staring and agitated
people, who packed the streets and made
black the tops of the houses. A murmur of
pity for the little vicomte, sitting in the bottom
of the cart, and talking so cheerfully, swept
over the multitude. The women in the throbbing
crowds asked each other his name and
sometimes broke into sobbing as he passed.
This agitated compassion troubled the boy,
and he said, with his lips trembling a little:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish they would not say &#8216;Poor lad!
Poor little boy!&#8217; I am afraid it will make me
weep, and that is what I should hate to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are a man, you will not weep,&#8221; answered
the duke, who knew what chord to
touch. &#8220;You should say to them: &#8216;Ladies,
I would take off my hat to you if my hands
were not tied.&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>The boy&#8217;s eyes sparkled; he loved to play
the man and the gallant; so he spoke to the
crowd as the duke had told him, and was innocently
vain of his own coolness.</p>

<p>At last, the carts, jolting steadily onward,
reached the vast clear space of the Place de la
R&eacute;volution, crammed with people, and in the
open place in the middle a great Thing, black
and gaunt, reared itself high in the air. At
the top a blade of blue steel blazed in the sunset
glow.</p>

<p>The first to dismount from the carts was
gentle Madame Elizabeth. She seated herself
placidly on one of the twenty-four chairs
ranged around in the circle. For the first
time it was noted of this simple and kindly
creature, once known as a Child of France,
something majestic in her demeanor. She
looked about her calmly, as much as to say:
&#8220;It matters little to me, Elizabeth, a Daughter
of France, what you may do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another woman, who had also been meek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
all her life, showed a stateliness of bearing
which might well become a duchess. This
was Trimousette, Duchess of Belgarde. She
was the next to alight, after Madame Elizabeth,
and took her place of rank, next the
royal princess, first making her a low curtsey,
which the princess rose and returned.
Each lady present made two curtseys to this
royal lady and each man two bows, one on
dismounting from the cart, and another before
ascending the rude stairs to the platform
where the glittering ax worked in its groove.
The most graceful bow of all was made by
the Duke of Belgarde; the most debonair by
the Vicomte d&#8217;Aronda.</p>

<p>The condemned persons passed in the order
of their rank; those of the lowest rank going
first. The little vicomte being last of all,
except the Duke and Duchess of Belgarde,
passed before the royal lady, sitting still and
stately in her rough wooden chair. Twenty
persons mounted the stairs to the platform,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
and twenty times the ax flashed up and down
in its groove. From the surging multitudes
around came occasionally gaspings and sobbings,
and even sometimes a wild shriek cut
the twilight air. But not one sob or shriek
came from those who went to their death,
each passing bravely and silently.</p>

<p>The twenty-first name to be called was that
of Citizen d&#8217;Aronda, and the little vicomte,
standing up, cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am here&mdash;Louis Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric, Vicomte
d&#8217;Aronda!&#8221;</p>

<p>He went first to Trimousette and kneeled
to kiss her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Au revoir, madame,&#8221; he cried; &#8220;we meet
again shortly, but meanwhile I shall have seen
madame, my mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we shall meet soon, and in the greatest
happiness,&#8221; answered Trimousette. Her
voice trembled a little&mdash;she had been less
brave about the boy than about anything
else. And the duke called out in a pleasant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
voice, just as if the lad were a full-grown
man:</p>

<p>&#8220;Au revoir, my comrade!&#8221;</p>

<p>The vicomte made his reverence to Madame
Elizabeth, who rose and returned it as if the
lad were a Marshal of France. In another
minute he was springing up the wooden steps,
and some women in the crowd began weeping
loudly, but were soon quieted by the rude
words and blows of the guards. Trimousette
did not see what happened next. Her eyes
were fixed upon the west, in which the single
star was growing more beautifully brilliant
every moment.</p>

<p>Then it became the turn of Citizen Belgarde,
once known as the Duke of Belgarde. He
knelt and kissed Trimousette&#8217;s hand and rose
and kissed her cheek, saying with a smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe with the little lad that God is
a gentleman, and has not brought us together
only to tear us apart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trimousette answered with the sweet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
bright smile which had only been hers since
her honeymoon began:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a good belief. Wait for me there,&#8221;
and pointed toward the star, now shining
large and bright in the purple heavens.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she turned away her head,
and two warm tears ran down her cheeks.
Most men die as they have lived, and so did
Fernand, Duke of Belgarde. After making
his reverence to Madame Elizabeth, the duke
walked up the rude stairs coolly, his steady
tread resounding loudly. Then he shouted out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Long live the King!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a sudden crash, some movement
and commotion on the scaffold. Then all was
over in this world for the Duke of Belgarde,
and but little remained for the wife who had
ever loved him better than her life.</p>

<p>Trimousette rose quickly, made her reverence
to Madame Elizabeth, and when her
name was called she was already standing at
the foot of the wooden steps.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>Every man who looked at Trimousette
wished to help her; even one of the guards,
seeing how small and slight she was, would
have assisted her, but she said to him with a
kind of gentle haughtiness:</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you, monsieur, but I do not need
your help.&#8221;</p>

<p>The executioner tore the white fichu from
her neck, leaving its unsunned beauty exposed
to the gaze of thousands of eyes. Trimousette&#8217;s
black eyes flashed, and a deep red
blush flooded her face and milk-white neck.
She turned for one moment toward the star

<p class="ph2">A ROMANCE OF THE CIVIL WAR.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="large"><b>The Victory.</b></span></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Molly Elliott Seawell</span>, author of &#8220;The
Chateau of Montplaisir,&#8221; &#8220;The Sprightly Romance
of Marsac,&#8221; etc. Illustrated. Cloth, $1.50.</p>


<p>&#8220;With so delicate a touch and appreciation of the detail
of domestic and plantation life, with so wise comprehension
of the exalted and sometimes stilted notions of Southern
honor and with humorous depiction of African fidelity and
bombast to interest and amuse him, it only gradually dawns
on a reader that &#8216;The Victory&#8217; is the truest and most
tragic presentation yet before us of the rending of home
ties, the awful passions, the wounded affections personal
and national, and the overwhelming questions of honor
which weighed down a people in the war of son against
father and brother against brother.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Hartford Courant.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Among the many romances written recently about the
Civil War, this one by Miss Seawell takes a high place....
Altogether, &#8216;The Victory,&#8217; a title significant in several
ways, makes a strong appeal to the lover of a good tale.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The
Outlook.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Seawell&#8217;s narrative is not only infused with a
tender and sympathetic spirit of romance and surcharged
with human interests, but discloses, in addition, careful and
minute study of local conditions and characteristic mannerisms.
It is an intimate study of life on a Virginia
plantation during an emergent and critical period of American
history.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia North American.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;It is one of the romances that make, by spirit as well as
letter, for youth and high feeling. It embodies, perhaps, the
best work this author yet has done.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Chicago Record-Herald.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Aside from the engaging story itself and the excellent
manner in which it is told there is much of historic interest
in this vivid word-picture of the customs and manners of a
period which has formed the background of much fiction.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Brooklyn
Citizen.</i></p>

<p>A Novel by <span class="smcap">Robert W. Chambers</span>. Illustrated
by G. C. Wilmshurst. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p>This is a famous novel of New York society; a
brilliant picture of American wealth in its romance,
its sins, its splendors, its divorces and its sports;
a love story such as only Robert W. Chambers can
write. It is stronger, tenser, better than the same
author&#8217;s greatest, success, &#8220;The Fighting Chance.&#8221;
Richly illustrated by G. C. Wilmshurst.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is brightly told, replete with the wit and sparkle
and charm that invests everything Mr. Chambers writes.
It is a delightful sojourn among people one could wish to
know.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Kansas City Star.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;It is written with a freshness and vigor that cannot be
too much appreciated and praised.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Salt Lake Tribune.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;It is the best story Mr. Chambers has ever written.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Cleveland

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
